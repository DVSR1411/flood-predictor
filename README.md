# Flood Prediction using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This is a machine learning program developed for flood prediction using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Flooding is a natural disaster that can cause significant damage to infrastructure and human life. Predicting floods accurately can help authorities take timely preventive measures and mitigate the impact of such disasters.

## Introduction

The program utilizes SVM, a supervised learning algorithm, to analyze historical data related to rainfall, river levels, soil moisture, and other relevant factors. Based on this analysis, the SVM model can predict the likelihood of floods occurring in a given area within a specific timeframe.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze historical data to identify patterns and correlations related to flood occurrences.
- **Model Training**: Train the SVM model using the processed data to make accurate flood predictions.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict the probability of floods based on current environmental conditions.
- **User Interface**: Optionally, develop a user interface for easy interaction with the program.

## Dataset

The program requires a dataset containing historical data on rainfall, river levels, soil moisture, and any other relevant features. This dataset should be labeled with flood occurrences to facilitate supervised learning.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the dataset by cleaning and preprocessing the data.
2. **Model Training**: Train the SVM model using the prepared dataset.
3. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict floods based on current environmental data.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Deployment**: Optionally, deploy the trained model for real-time flood prediction.

## Dependencies

The program may require the following dependencies:

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
